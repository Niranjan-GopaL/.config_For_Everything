# Archive

It contains all the projects, portfolios, and other files that 
are either replaced or don't match the quality I hope to bring.

- My github Profile in my first year
- My Dev Portfolio created in my  first year
- ALL MY ARCHIVED DOTFILES in my first year (neovim, vs code, powershell, zsh, etc.) 

(So that I don't forget the way I came from)
