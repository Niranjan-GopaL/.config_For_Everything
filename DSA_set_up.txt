code editor : VSC ( but trying to get used to vim )
extensions  : cph
lang        : python and c++ ( trying to fool around in Rust but hard time )

<-- HOW TO have <bits/std.h> included in VSC -->

1)VSC looks for all the header files in a folder called "include":
    Eg: C:\Program Files\C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.34.31933\include\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.34.31933\include

    It could be in Program Files (x86) also. What you have to look for is 'Microsoft Visual Studio\2022' 
    or whatever year you are running. Then find VC ( has all the config for VSC).

2) clone the repo https://github.com/priyank-mungra/bits.git if you don't already have bits folder in
    your mingw folder
