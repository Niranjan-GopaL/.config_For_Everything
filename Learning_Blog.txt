sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove neovim (For re-installing )
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim



1) apt does not install latest version by default so I havde to add https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/stable

Reddit user :- 

I use the ppa:

	http://ppa.launchpad.net/neovim-ppa/stable/ubuntu bionic/main amd64
	having followed the instructions at:

	https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#ubuntu

	I like being able to

	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
	with few outside packages to remember.

2) now on sudo apt install neovim (v0.7)

I WORK ON MULTIPLE MULTIPLE PROJECTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And to keep track of all the editors is not that good of an expirience. 
Heard Tmux is a really good solution (Tmuxifier to be precise)

MY ZSH CONFIG IN WIN TERMINAL-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

F11 => Maximised Focus mode ( That looks insanely awesome!! )
alt + arrows to move from one split to another
Just learn LINUX now , bash script , then you will be golden

WHY YOU NEED TO MASTER TERMINAL EDITORS :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Been using Emacs for 9 years at this point. Right now, I'm such an outlier since everyone uses VsCode but recently 
we picked up some infrastructure work migrate a lot of our services from Service Fabric to k8s, and what was so telling 
about the nature of this work is that it really exposed the biggest flaw that a lot of developers have right now and 
that is that they don't their way around the filesystem that well. Occasionally, I still use Vim whenever I have 
to ssh into one of our clusters to debug something because it's more lightweight, but even in a resource limited 
environment I still know my way around, and seeing how reliant a lot of engineers that a lot are more senior than 
I am on their IDE really justified my use of terminal editors. The point of what I'm trying to say is that in software 
development there is a hell of a lot more to it than just writing code. Having and IDE or using tools like VsCode may 
make it easier to write code and debug when you're a beginner and your apps only live on your localhost but once you 
progress into the realm of developing globally distributed systems and your code base becomes exponentially larger and 
more complex, you won't have the luxury of running the code you're writing in a feature rich editor like an IDE and a 
majority of the time debugging involves you querying output logs or remotely connecting into one of your nodes and 
using command line tools to figure out what went wrong. Interpret this however you like.
