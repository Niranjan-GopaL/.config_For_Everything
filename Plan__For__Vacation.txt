STUFF TO DO IN THE ONE WEEK HOLIDAY --------------------------------------

-   Learn more about github in 3 or 4 hours (continous)
    (just read Atlassian and use GPT to explain analogies)

-   UNDERSTANDING AND BEING ABLE TO MODIFY WHAT YOU BUILT DURING working days is THE MSOT IMPORTANT POINT:=
    Learn React :-  Use ChatGPT, Nerd's Lessons or whatever best you find after going through your Tresure Box.
		Make notes in Notion (You already have a React Folder)

-   Get Propheteer and Youtube clone in a really good place.

-   Linux Udemy Course.

-   Node and Express tutorial (that build 4 projects one) and Go backend tutorial









FUN:-
