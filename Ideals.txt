BURNING IDEALS ------------------------------------------


1) Breathing Control Visual:-

	"like a ball that oscillates with more and more amplitude
	with each breath, once you hit the maximum amplitude attainable 
			"your mind becomes empty and clear" "

2) Act the Fool, Never EVER REVEAL YOURSELF.
	if you ever give in to the temptation to share what you
	are going through :-

	"Your plan will fall through. You will be made fun of 
	if you fail."

	So just NEVER TELL ANYONE.

3) Never forget your bottle of Talents and Competence. It might 
   not as cool as others near you, But it's potential can change
   the very world you live in.
